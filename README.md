# Milk_Instancer_URP
 Unity indirect GPU instancing & painting with culling and LODs in URP
 
 This version of the project is to be archived. I am completelely refactoring consolidating all the projects into the main one - https://github.com/Milk-Drinker01/Milk_Instancer01

A WIP version of Milk_Instancer that works in the universal render pipeline. heres a list of things that are still WIP
 - foliage shading: it currently sucks in this project
 - Occlusion culling: not currently supported, ~~probably wont be supported ever, unless someone wants to contribute and create a method for obtaining an HIZ depth texture~~ ive gotten more familiar with urp, and this will be supported when i feel like it.
